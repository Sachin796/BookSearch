1.	How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 

- I have spend 1.5 days to complete the coding assessment

a.	What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

- I would like to add more test cases by understanding how to implement in redux and not pure react.I would also like to add more functionalities and improve the user interface even better for a better User Experience.

b.	If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- N/A


2.	What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
-   I have made use of few datastructures like map,filter etc to parse throught the data.
-   I have made use of the latest ES6 syntax to code.

3.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- There are various monitoring and logging tools like CloudWatch,Datadog etc where you can see the production logs and that is how we can debug and resolve production issues. Yes I have faced this issue before and understand the severity of it.


4.	How would you improve the API that you just used?
-  One of the thing that was missing in the API was the response code/status. It was a challanging part in the frontend without using that. Also the overall structure of the API endpoints can be changed as many Endpoints gave unstructured data.
